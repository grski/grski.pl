Description: My thoughts on Pragmatic Innovation, declouding, hype driven development and why today's IT is doomed.

No, you do not need kubernetes and your fancy in-cloud remote development culture that in most cases only acts as an excuse to show shiny & trendy logos on the pitchdeck and hire overgrown and wildly unproductive X-ops teams. 
No, you do not need to use the latest and greatest AI/ML technology to solve your problems.
No, you do not need to use the latest and greatest frontend framework to build your website and then rewrite that in half a year because new one is on top or the author decided to drop support.

Stick to the basics, master them first. Iterate fast and often. Be lean.
