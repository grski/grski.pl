Description: A summary of my experiences in the past years, where I finally decided to put my stuff in order, battle my inner demons and improve myself, both personally and professionally.

A little more than 6 years ago, I wrote a first post on this blog. What a long way have we come since then. The world changed in so many ways no one expected. The war, covid, AI, just to get the list started. Back then I was still just a highschool student. Just starting out in IT. Nowadays I'm quite a skilled engineer, with already a bit of an estabilished career. My life, the people around me, my thoughts, plans and ideals have drastically changed. I feel like a new person. Especially recently.

A gross of the changes in my life have taken place last year. As a way to reflect on them, share my experiences, hurdles and obstacles I've faced, I decided to write this post. Very honest, down to earth and truthfull. Treat it as a katharsis of some sort. That implies, I won't always put myself in a good light here, as I've failed at many things too. The topics covered will be broad and diverse, ranging from PED, gym to AI. How it all ties together? No idea. Only common factor I see is myself. If you are in for that, go ahead. If you only find a particular topic interesting, feel free to skip the rest, however I encourage you to take a look at everything, it's quite novel!



## Health

### Gym

### PED / Supplements

### Diet

### Therapy

### Addiction



## Professional life

 

As cheesy as it may sound, (well, it is) regular sleep schedule, exercise, proper diet, sobriety and other basic stuff like that make a HUGE difference. They made me stable and motivated enough to get me going in other areas.
I can't stress enough how important this actually is.
