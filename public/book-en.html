                <div class="content">
                    <p>Two years ago I published my own book about Python - Junior Python Developer. 256 pages of knowledge for those who want to start in Python. Now I'm open sourcing it. You can still buy it if you want to show support, however now it's readily available for free.</p>
<p>I truly believe in idea of open education as I benefitted from it through my career tremendously given that I'm a self-taught engineer. So to add on top of that I've also added English translation. </p>
<p>Best part yet? </p>
<p>I did with #cursor in #agentic mode with around 2 hours. Worked like a charm almost from the get-go. Except that it at first pass only translated excerpts from the chapters, but small prompt tweak and boom. It worked.</p>
<p>Took 2 hours what it'd take me weeks to achieve.</p>
<p>Is the translation perfect? No, but mine also wouldn't be. It's good enough in my books to share my thoughts and my knowledge. Ofc it needed some further editing and polishing around the edges. But... given that now I just made it open source, it's a challange for you ;)</p>
<p>This is the beauty of AI currently. Enabling you to do more, not replacing you. I think this is the future of work. You can do more, faster, better. And you can focus on the things that matter.</p>
<p>In my opinion AI will not replace you, but it will replace the people who don't use it.</p>
<p>Same as Django did not replace web developers, it actually made them more productive and unleashed a whole new wave of web development and projects making things possible which till then were deemed impossible.</p>
